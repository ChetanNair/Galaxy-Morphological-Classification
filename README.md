This project looks at classifying galaxies morphologically from their images. The images are obtained from the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset. The keras framework for Python has been used to create and train a convolutional neural network for the purpose of classification. Numpy, and pandas are used for data processing. Tensorflow's tensoboard was used to log and view analytics while training the model.
